Current Goal: Keep the agent protocol top-of-mind and ensure every repo change is logged with a granular worklog.

Last 3 Changes:
- agent/worklogs/2026-02-13-commit-containerfile-readme.md
- agent/worklogs/2026-02-13-update-readme-flags.md
- agent/worklogs/2026-02-13-git-config.md

Next Steps:
- Create a worklog before making edits and update `agent/CONTEXT.md` immediately after.
- Await the user's next instruction to proceed with repository changes.
