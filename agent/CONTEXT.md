Current Goal: Keep the agent protocol top-of-mind and ensure every repo change is logged with a granular worklog.

Last 3 Changes:
- agent/worklogs/2026-02-15-17-58-commit-changed-files.md
- agent/worklogs/2026-02-14-19-25-pin-context.md
- agent/worklogs/2026-02-13-commit-containerfile-readme.md

Next Steps:
- Run repository tests and linters (if present) and address any failures.
- Await further instructions from the user.
